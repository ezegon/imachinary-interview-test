# Interview Test for Fullstack Developer @iMachinary

## The proposed exercise

Build a web page that rotates through a series of 4 predefined cities' weather every 10 seconds.

For the weather API, you can use this one: https://www.metaweather.com/api/

For the resources on React: https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react

Latitude and Longitude of some cities you can use:

* -34.603722, -58.381592
* -33.459229, -70.645348
* 40.730610, -73.935242
* (4th one to taste)

Additional features:
- A way for the user to add their own city
- An Express (https://expressjs.com/) or Feathers (https://feathersjs.com/) app to serve the web app
- A proxy version of the API in Express / Feathers that does the request to the public APIs on the server-side

### Instructions to run the solution

// To run the compiled project
